      "question": "Why did the Gun limiter become active in the FLASH LLRF station?",
      "answer": "The Gun limiter became active in the FLASH LLRF station because the operators reported that it was active. This issue was addressed on 2023-04-20 16:15, indicating a quick resolution. However, no specific details were provided in the context regarding what triggered the activation of the Gun limiter.",

It seems like the attempt done my the operators and FSM was just to fast. OVC did not converge before closing the FB and therefore limiters triggered which stopped the auto-recovery. It might be that this Setup is too tight, e.g. we should relax output att. as mentioned in the previous ticket to this issue.\n:",

      "question": "How did the operators address the issue of the phase increase at the end of flat top in ACC23?",
      "answer": "The operators mentioned that the phase raises at the end of flat top in ACC23. They suspected that the issue likely comes from incorrect settings with the IBFBF, but this was not within their expertise to fix. Despite this issue, the operators mentioned that they could live with it for the time being. They informed an expert that they would ask for assistance the following day.",

Trying to go higher the output signal was completely corrupted during filling time (both amplitude and phase) - like the signal overrun the number range. OVC reset, output limiter did not helped. Suspected initially SEU (since the board panel showed some red CRC numbers). The crate reboot did not help. After that, the trial to adjust the signal level with the VM attenuator was successful (change from 5dB to 2dB). Not clear what triggered this change. Before the ZZ station was running well with 5dB and after ZZ it was necessary to reduce attenuation to 2dB.\n:"
